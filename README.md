## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to define some patterns and best practices for building out a training codebase.

It contains code demonstrating:

- Using google storage buckets as data sources
- Triggering AI Platform runs
- Using MLFlow for experiment tracking
- Building Docker Images for training tasks

--- Not yet Implemented ---

- Using hyperparameter Tuning for training models
- Using PyTorch to to train models
